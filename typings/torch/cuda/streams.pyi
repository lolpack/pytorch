    A CUDA stream is a linear sequence of execution that belongs to a specific
    device, independent from other streams. It supports with statement as a
    context manager to ensure the operators within the with block are running
    on the corresponding stream.  See :ref:`cuda-semantics` for details.

    Args:
        device(torch.device or int, optional): a device on which to allocate
            the stream. If :attr:`device` is ``None`` (default) or a negative
            integer, this will use the current device.
        priority(int, optional): priority of the stream, which can be positive, 0, or negative.
            A lower number indicates a higher priority. By default, the priority is set to 0.
            If the value falls outside of the allowed priority range, it will automatically be
            mapped to the nearest valid priority (lowest for large positive numbers or
            highest for large negative numbers).

class Event(torch._C._CudaEventBase):
    r"""Wrapper around a CUDA event.

    CUDA events are synchronization markers that can be used to monitor the
    device's progress, to accurately measure timing, and to synchronize CUDA
    streams.

    The underlying CUDA events are lazily initialized when the event is first
    recorded or exported to another process. After creation, only streams on the
    same device may record the event. However, streams on any device can wait on
    the event.

    Args:
        enable_timing (bool, optional): indicates if the event should measure time
            (default: ``False``)
        blocking (bool, optional): if ``True``, :meth:`wait` will be blocking (default: ``False``)
        interprocess (bool): if ``True``, the event can be shared between processes
            (default: ``False``)
        external (bool, optional): indicates whether this event should create event record and event wait nodes, or create an internal cross-stream dependency, when captured in a cuda graph.
