    r"""
    Fills the Tensors in tensor.local_shards with values according to the method
    described in `Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing human-level
    performance on ImageNet classification` - He, K. et al. (2015), using a
    uniform distribution. The resulting tensor will have values sampled from
    :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\text{bound}, \text{bound})` where
    .. math::
        \text{bound} = \text{gain} \times \sqrt{\frac{3}{\text{fan\_mode}}}
    Also known as He initialization.
    Args:
        tensor: tensor sharded across devices
        a: the negative slope of the rectifier used after this layer (only
            used with ``'leaky_relu'``)
        mode: either ``'fan_in'`` (default) or ``'fan_out'``. Choosing ``'fan_in'``
            preserves the magnitude of the variance of the weights in the
            forward pass. Choosing ``'fan_out'`` preserves the magnitudes in the
            backwards pass.
        nonlinearity: the non-linear function (`nn.functional` name),
            recommended to use only with ``'relu'`` or ``'leaky_relu'`` (default).
