class PeriodicModelAverager(ModelAverager):
    r"""
    Averages parameters periodically after the warm-up stage.

    This can be used for running `post-local SGD <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07217>`_,
    by running :class:`~torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` (DDP)
    using the subgroups created by :meth:`~torch.distributed.new_subgroups`.

    Args:
        period (int): The number of steps per model averaging.
                      Usually the period should be greater than ``1`` to reduce the communication cost.
                      Otherwise, only DDP needs to be used.
        warmup_steps (int): The number of warm-up steps. During this stage,
                            model averaging is skipped.
        process_group: The process group to be used for all-reduce.
                       If ``None``, the default process group, which
                       is created by :func:`torch.distributed.init_process_group`,
                       will be used. (default: ``None``)
