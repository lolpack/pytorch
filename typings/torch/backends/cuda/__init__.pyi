    Override the heuristic PyTorch uses to choose between cuSOLVER and MAGMA for CUDA linear algebra operations.

    .. warning:: This flag is experimental and subject to change.

    When PyTorch runs a CUDA linear algebra operation it often uses the cuSOLVER or MAGMA libraries,
    and if both are available it decides which to use with a heuristic.
    This flag (a :class:`str`) allows overriding those heuristics.

    * If `"cusolver"` is set then cuSOLVER will be used wherever possible.
    * If `"magma"` is set then MAGMA will be used wherever possible.
    * If `"default"` (the default) is set then heuristics will be used to pick between
      cuSOLVER and MAGMA if both are available.
    * When no input is given, this function returns the currently preferred library.
    * User may use the environment variable TORCH_LINALG_PREFER_CUSOLVER=1 to set the preferred library to cuSOLVER
      globally.
      This flag only sets the initial value of the preferred library and the preferred library
      may still be overridden by this function call later in your script.

    Note: When a library is preferred other libraries may still be used if the preferred library
    doesn't implement the operation(s) called.
    This flag may achieve better performance if PyTorch's heuristic library selection is incorrect
    for your application's inputs.

    Currently supported linalg operators:

    * :func:`torch.linalg.inv`
    * :func:`torch.linalg.inv_ex`
    * :func:`torch.linalg.cholesky`
    * :func:`torch.linalg.cholesky_ex`

    When PyTorch runs a CUDA BLAS operation it defaults to cuBLAS even if both cuBLAS and cuBLASLt are available.
    For PyTorch built for ROCm, hipBLAS, hipBLASLt, and CK may offer different performance.
    This flag (a :class:`str`) allows overriding which BLAS library to use.

    * If `"cublas"` is set then cuBLAS will be used wherever possible.
    * If `"cublaslt"` is set then cuBLASLt will be used wherever possible.
    * If `"ck"` is set then CK will be used wherever possible.
    * If `"default"` (the default) is set then heuristics will be used to pick between the other options.
