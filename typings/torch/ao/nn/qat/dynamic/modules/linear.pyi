    A linear module attached with FakeQuantize modules for weight,
    used for dynamic quantization aware training.

    We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.Linear`, please see
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Linear
    for documentation.

    Similar to `torch.nn.Linear`, with FakeQuantize modules initialized to
    default.
