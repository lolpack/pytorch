    This pass is useful for readability of the exported ONNX graph. It restores the
    parameter and buffer names from the original nn.module. For example, if the original
    nn.module has a parameter named `root.linear.0.weight`, and the parameter is renamed to
    `_param_constant9` by FX, this pass will rename it back.

    This pass must be run after `Decompose` pass. Because this pass is expected to be called on
    `fx.GraphModule` produced by `proxy_tensor.make_fx`, where all parameters and buffers
    are registered at root level.
