    """
    This function creates a dictionary of op overloads and their decomposition functions
    for ops that do not have ONNX symbolic functions. If an op already has an ONNX symbolic function,
    its decomposition function is excluded from the table. The decomposition table is a subset of PyTorch's
    built-in aten-to-aten decomposition.

    Args:
        registry: The ONNX registry for PyTorch.

    Returns:
        Dict[torch._ops.OperatorBase, Callable]: A dictionary that maps op overloads to their corresponding
        decomposition functions.
