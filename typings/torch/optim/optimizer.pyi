        * ``state``: a Dict holding current optimization state. Its content

            hold. For example, state is saved per parameter, and the parameter
            itself is NOT saved. ``state`` is a Dictionary mapping parameter ids
            to a Dict with state corresponding to each parameter.
        * ``param_groups``: a List containing all parameter groups where each
            parameter group is a Dict. Each parameter group contains metadata
            specific to the optimizer, such as learning rate and weight decay,
            as well as a List of parameter IDs of the parameters in the group.
            If a param group was initialized with ``named_parameters()`` the names
            content will also be saved in the state dict.

        NOTE: The parameter IDs may look like indices but they are just IDs
        associating state with param_group. When loading from a state_dict,
        the optimizer will zip the param_group ``params`` (int IDs) and the
        optimizer ``param_groups`` (actual ``nn.Parameter`` s) in order to
