        r"""Computes the gradient of current tensor wrt graph leaves.

        The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If the tensor is
        non-scalar (i.e. its data has more than one element) and requires
        gradient, the function additionally requires specifying a ``gradient``.
        It should be a tensor of matching type and shape, that represents
        the gradient of the differentiated function w.r.t. ``self``.

        This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero
        ``.grad`` attributes or set them to ``None`` before calling it.
        See :ref:`Default gradient layouts<default-grad-layouts>`
        for details on the memory layout of accumulated gradients.

        .. note::

            If you run any forward ops, create ``gradient``, and/or call ``backward``
            in a user-specified CUDA stream context, see
            :ref:`Stream semantics of backward passes<bwd-cuda-stream-semantics>`.

        .. note::

            When ``inputs`` are provided and a given input is not a leaf,
            the current implementation will call its grad_fn (though it is not strictly needed to get this gradients).
            It is an implementation detail on which the user should not rely.
            See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/60521#issuecomment-867061780 for more details.

        Args:
            gradient (Tensor, optional): The gradient of the function
                being differentiated w.r.t. ``self``.
                This argument can be omitted if ``self`` is a scalar. Defaults to ``None``.
            retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grads will be freed;
                If ``True``, it will be retained. The default is ``None``, in which case the value is inferred from ``create_graph``
                (i.e., the graph is retained only when higher-order derivative tracking is requested). Note that in nearly all cases
                setting this option to True is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient way.
            create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, graph of the derivative will
                be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative
                products. Defaults to ``False``.
            inputs (Sequence[Tensor], optional): Inputs w.r.t. which the gradient will be
                accumulated into ``.grad``. All other tensors will be ignored. If not
                provided, the gradient is accumulated into all the leaf Tensors that were
                used to compute the :attr:`tensors`. Defaults to ``None``.

        The hook will be called every time a gradient with respect to the

        The hook should not modify its argument, but it can optionally return

        The hook will be called after all gradients for a tensor have been accumulated,
        meaning that the .grad field has been updated on that tensor. The post
        accumulate grad hook is ONLY applicable for leaf tensors (tensors without a
        .grad_fn field). Registering this hook on a non-leaf tensor will error!

        The hook should have the following signature::

            hook(param: Tensor) -> None

        Note that, unlike other autograd hooks, this hook operates on the tensor
        that requires grad and not the grad itself. The hook can in-place modify
        and access its Tensor argument, including its .grad field.

        This function returns a handle with a method ``handle.remove()``
        that removes the hook from the module.

            See :ref:`backward-hooks-execution` for more information on how when this hook
            is executed, and how its execution is ordered relative to other hooks. Since
            this hook runs during the backward pass, it will run in no_grad mode (unless
            create_graph is True). You can use torch.enable_grad() to re-enable autograd
            within the hook if you need it.

            ambiguity_check (bool or List[torch.memory_format]): The check method for ambiguity of dim order.

        Examples::

            >>> torch.empty((2, 3, 5, 7)).dim_order()
            (0, 1, 2, 3)
            >>> torch.empty((2, 3, 5, 7)).transpose(1, 2).dim_order()
            (0, 2, 1, 3)
            >>> torch.empty((2, 3, 5, 7), memory_format=torch.channels_last).dim_order()
            (0, 2, 3, 1)
            >>> torch.empty((1, 2, 3, 4)).dim_order()
            (0, 1, 2, 3)
            >>> try:
            ...     torch.empty((1, 2, 3, 4)).dim_order(ambiguity_check=True)
            ... except RuntimeError as e:
            ...     print(e)
            The tensor does not have unique dim order, or cannot map to exact one of the given memory formats.
            >>> torch.empty((1, 2, 3, 4)).dim_order(
            ...     ambiguity_check=[torch.contiguous_format, torch.channels_last]
            ... )  # It can be mapped to contiguous format
            (0, 1, 2, 3)
            >>> try:
            ...     torch.empty((1, 2, 3, 4)).dim_order(ambiguity_check="ILLEGAL")
            ... except TypeError as e:
            ...     print(e)
            The ambiguity_check argument must be a bool or a list of memory formats.

            The dim_order tensor API is experimental and subject to change.

        This __torch_function__ implementation wraps subclasses such that
        methods called on subclasses return a subclass instance instead of
        a ``torch.Tensor`` instance.

        One corollary to this is that you need coverage for torch.Tensor
        methods if implementing __torch_function__ for subclasses.

        We recommend always calling ``super().__torch_function__`` as the base
        case when doing the above.

        While not mandatory, we recommend making `__torch_function__` a classmethod.

        Creates a DLpack `capsule https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/design_topics/data_interchange.html#data-interchange`_
        of the current tensor to be exported to other libraries.

        This function will be called from the `from_dlpack` method
        of the library that will consume the capsule. `from_dlpack` passes the current
        stream to this method as part of the specification.

        Args:
            stream (integer or None): An optional Python integer representing a
            pointer to a CUDA stream. The current stream is synchronized with
            this stream before the capsule is created, and since the capsule
            shares its storage with the tensor this make it safe to access from
            both streams.  If None or -1 is passed then no synchronization is performed.
            If 1 (on CUDA) or 0 (on ROCM) then the default stream is used for
            synchronization.
