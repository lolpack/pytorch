    r"""Check gradients computed via small finite differences against analytical
    gradients wrt tensors in :attr:`inputs` that are of floating point or complex type
    and with ``requires_grad=True``.

    The check between numerical and analytical gradients uses :func:`~torch.allclose`.

    For most of the complex functions we consider for optimization purposes, no notion of
    Jacobian exists. Instead, gradcheck verifies if the numerical and analytical values of
    the Wirtinger and Conjugate Wirtinger derivatives are consistent. Because the gradient
    computation is done under the assumption that the overall function has a real-valued
    output, we treat functions with complex output in a special way. For these functions,
    gradcheck is applied to two real-valued functions corresponding to taking the real
    components of the complex outputs for the first, and taking the imaginary components
    of the complex outputs for the second. For more details, check out
    :ref:`complex_autograd-doc`.

    .. note::
        The default values are designed for :attr:`input` of double precision.
        This check will likely fail if :attr:`input` is of less precision, e.g.,
        ``FloatTensor``.

    .. note::
        Gradcheck may fail when evaluated on non-differentiable points
        because the numerically computed gradients via finite differencing may differ
        those computed analytically (not necessarily because either is incorrect).
        For more context, see :ref:`non-differentiable-func-grad`.

    .. warning::
       If any checked tensor in :attr:`input` has overlapping memory, i.e.,
       different indices pointing to the same memory address (e.g., from
       :func:`torch.Tensor.expand`), this check will likely fail because the numerical
       gradients computed by point perturbation at such indices will change
       values at all other indices that share the same memory address.

    Args:
        func (function): a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns
            a Tensor or a tuple of Tensors
        inputs (tuple of Tensor or Tensor): inputs to the function
        eps (float, optional): perturbation for finite differences

        rtol (float, optional): relative tolerance
        raise_exception (bool, optional): indicating whether to raise an exception if
            the check fails. The exception gives more information about the
            exact nature of the failure. This is helpful when debugging gradchecks.
        nondet_tol (float, optional): tolerance for non-determinism. When running
            identical inputs through the differentiation, the results must either match
            exactly (default, 0.0) or be within this tolerance.
        check_undefined_grad (bool, optional): if ``True``, check if undefined output grads
            are supported and treated as zeros, for ``Tensor`` outputs.
        check_batched_grad (bool, optional): if ``True``, check if we can compute
            batched gradients using prototype vmap support. Defaults to False.
        check_batched_forward_grad (bool, optional): if ``True``, checks if we can compute
            batched forward gradients using forward ad and prototype vmap support. Defaults to ``False``.
        check_forward_ad (bool, optional): if ``True``, check that the gradients computed with forward
            mode AD match the numerical ones. Defaults to ``False``.
        check_backward_ad (bool, optional): if ``False``, do not perform any checks that rely on
            backward mode AD to be implemented. Defaults to ``True``.
        fast_mode (bool, optional): Fast mode for gradcheck and gradgradcheck is currently only
            implemented for R to R functions. If none of the inputs and outputs are complex
            a faster implementation of gradcheck that no longer computes the entire jacobian
            is run; otherwise, we fall back to the slow implementation.
        masked (bool, optional): if ``True``, the gradients of unspecified elements of
            sparse tensors are ignored. Defaults to ``False``.
    Returns:
        ``True`` if all differences satisfy allclose condition
