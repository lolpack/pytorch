"""
Contains utility functions for working with nested python data structures.

A *pytree* is Python nested data structure. It is a tree in the sense that
nodes are Python collections (e.g., list, tuple, dict) and the leaves are
Python values. Furthermore, a pytree should not contain reference cycles.

pytrees are useful for working with nested collections of Tensors. For example,
one can use `tree_map` to map a function over all Tensors inside some nested
collection of Tensors and `tree_leaves` to get a flat list of all Tensors
inside some nested collection. pytrees are helpful for implementing nested
collection support for PyTorch APIs.

This pytree implementation is not very performant due to Python overhead
To improve the performance we can move parts of the implementation to C++.

    In a :func:`torch.compile` region, if instances of these types get passed to
    :func:`torch._dynamo.nonstrict_trace`-ed function, they treated as a

    1. if the instance object existed before the :func:`torch.compile` region,
    we _assume_ no mutation will happen to it inside the :func:`torch.compile`
    region, require that it has non-default `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods, and
    we guard on the instance based on its `__eq__` method, i.e., if a new

    :func:`torch.compile` will recompile the function using the new instance.

    2. else if the instance object is created inside the :func:`torch.compile`
    region, we currently don't support using it in a
    :func:`torch._dynamo.nonstrict_trace`-ed function.

    In general, if your class holds Tensors or dynamic int/float/bool (values that
    may change from run-to-run of a function being compiled), then you probably
    do not want to register it as a constant.

    Otherwise if you want to pass instance of a class to a

    :func:`register_pytree_node` on the class, or the class is "constant" enough
