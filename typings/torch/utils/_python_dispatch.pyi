    """
    A ``TorchDispatchMode`` allows you to override the meaning of all
    ``__torch_dispatch__`` overrideable functions within a dynamic scope,
    without having to actually create a tensor subclass or manually
    monkey-patch functions in the PyTorch API.  Some common situations
    where you should use a mode:

        * You want to override the meaning of factory functions, or other
          functions that do not otherwise take a tensor as an argument
          (these cannot be overridden with tensor subclasses).

        * You want to override the behavior of all functions without needing
          to wrap your inputs in tensor subclasses; e.g., if you are just
          interested in logging intermediate computations.

        * You want to control the order of execution of various tensor
          subclasses explicitly, rather than implicitly via the return of
          ``NotImplemented``.

    Independent subclasses of :class:`TorchDispatchMode` are compositional:
    modes can be pushed onto a stack using ``with MyMode():``.
    When you call functions in the PyTorch API inside your
    ``__torch_dispatch__`` implementation, by default, they will forward on to
    the next mode on the mode stack.  If you want recursively call back into
    your current ``__torch_dispatch__`` implementation, either explicitly
    invoke ``self.__torch_dispatch__(...)``, or use the context manager
    ``__torch_dispatch__(self)`` to make PyTorch
    API self-referential (beware of infinite loops, in this case!)

    """
    Returns whether or not a tensor subclass that implements __torch_dispatch__
    is 'traceable' with torch.compile.
    In order for a tensor subclass to support TorchDispatchMode-style tracing in PT2,
    It must implement two magic methods: __tensor_flatten__ and __tensor_unflatten__.
    It is also expected to obey some restrictions around traceability and aliasing:
        * The subclass's __torch_dispatch__() implementation should desugar into pytorch
            dispatcher operations that can be traced into a graph.
        * The subclass should use return_and_correct_aliasing(). This is needed today to make
            sure that torch.compile does the right thing in a few cases around input mutation
            and output aliasing.

    Expected magic method signatures:
        attrs, ctx = t.__tensor_flatten__()
            attrs: list of attribute name strings for inner tensors
            ctx: dict containing any other subclass-specific metadata needed for unflattening

        t = MySubClass.__tensor_unflatten__(inner_tensors, ctx, outer_size, outer_stride)
            inner_tensors: dict mapping attribute name -> tensor for each inner tensor
            ctx: dict with subclass metadata in the form that __tensor_flatten__() produces
            outer_size: expected (possibly symbolic) size that the returned subclass
                instance should have. Note that this arg is useful for certain subclasses
                that require the shape info to be constructed. In most cases, this arg can be
                safely ignored.
            outer_stride: expected (possibly symbolic) stride that the returned subclass
                instance should have. Note that this arg is useful for certain subclasses
                that require the stride info to be constructed. In most cases, this arg can be
