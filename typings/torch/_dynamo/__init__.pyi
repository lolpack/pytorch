"""
TorchDynamo is a Python-level JIT compiler designed to make unmodified PyTorch programs faster.
TorchDynamo hooks into the frame evaluation API in CPython (PEP 523) to dynamically modify Python
bytecode right before it is executed. It rewrites Python bytecode in order to extract sequences of
PyTorch operations into an FX Graph which is then just-in-time compiled with a customizable backend.
It creates this FX Graph through bytecode analysis and is designed to mix Python execution with
compiled backends to get the best of both worlds: usability and performance. This allows it to
seamlessly optimize PyTorch programs, including those using modern Python features.

    a new process.  It does NOT affect any file system caches.
