"""
Core variable tracking functionality for Dynamo. This module defines the fundamental
classes and systems used to track and manage variables during Dynamo's operation.

The module provides:
1. VariableTracker - The base class for tracking variables during compilation
2. MutationType system - Classes for tracking and managing mutations to variables
3. Source type management - Utilities for tracking variable origins and scope
4. Variable state management - Tools for managing variable state and transformations

These components form the foundation of Dynamo's variable handling system,
enabling accurate tracking and transformation of Python code into optimized
computations.

    This Enum divides VariableTracker into 2 cases, depending on the variable

    - already existed that Dynamo began tracking while introspection (Existing)
    - is a new variable that is created during Dynamo introspection (New)

    In general, we have these invariants:
    1. for `VariableTracker` associated with `Existing`, its `source` field must not be None.
    2. for `VariableTracker` associated with `New`, most of the time its
       `source` field is None, except for cases like side effect codegen for
       `AttributeMutationNew`, during which we generate a
       `LocalSource('tmp...')` for such variable, to facilitate codegen.

            type: The Python type (such as int, str, list, etc.) of the variable tracked by
                the subclass. If the type cannot be determined or is not relevant,
