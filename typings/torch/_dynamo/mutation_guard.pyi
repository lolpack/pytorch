"""Mutation tracking and dynamic module detection system for Dynamo.

This module provides mechanisms to track and respond to mutations in PyTorch modules
and detect dynamically created or modified modules.

Key components:
- MutationTracker: Tracks mutations to objects and invalidates associated cached code
- GenerationTracker: Tracks module creation timing to identify dynamic instances
- Patching system for nn.Module to detect mutations and dynamic creation

The system ensures that Dynamo's optimizations remain valid by detecting and responding
to runtime changes in module state and structure.
