"""
This module provides the public comptime interface to TorchDynamo, enabling users to execute
arbitrary Python code during symbolic evaluation of their programs.

The comptime interface allows inspection and modification of TorchDynamo's compilation
process while it is running. This can be useful for:

- Debugging compilation issues
- Inspecting intermediate state
- Adding custom guards or graph breaks
- Analyzing symbolic shapes and values

Example usage:

    import torch
    from torch._dynamo.comptime import comptime

    def my_model(x):
        # Print the compile-time known information about x
        comptime.print(x)

        # Print the current FX graph being constructed
        comptime.print_graph()

        # Force a value to be treated as static
        if comptime(lambda ctx: ctx.get_local("x").is_dynamic()):
            comptime.force_static(x)

        # Add a manual graph break
        comptime.graph_break()

Note: While this API provides significant flexibility, it intentionally avoids
exposing internal implementation details of TorchDynamo to maintain compatibility
across versions.
"""
class ComptimeVar:
    """
    A ComptimeVar represents a Python value, at some particular point
    in time, in the Python code we are symbolically evaluating with
    torchdynamo.  This must be distinguished from a runtime value, as
    at compile-time there are some properties of the variable we
    do not know (for example, if the ComptimeVar represents a Tensor,
    we only know metadata about the tensor; we do NOT know what the
    actual data in the Tensor is.)

        Returns an fx.Proxy (or tuple/list of fx.Proxy) representing

        This method only works for variables we actually track in
        the FX graph, aka Tensors (and ints, if you are compiling
        with dynamic shapes).  In particular, if you have a list
        or tuple of tensors, you will get a list/tuple of proxies
