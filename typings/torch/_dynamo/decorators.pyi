    Register a polyfill handler for a function, usually a C function from the C extension, to be
    used in place of the original function when inlining the original function in the graph.

    .. note::

        The polyfill handler is only used when inlining the original function. It is not used when
        the original function is called directly. In the eager mode, the decorated function calls
        the performant C function rather than the polyfill handler.

    The polyfill handler is a function that will be called in place of the original function when
    inlining the original function. The polyfill handler should have the same signature and the same
    behavior as the original function.

    Args:
        original_fn (callable): The original function, usually a C function, to register a polyfill
            handler for.
        can_constant_fold_through (bool, optional): Whether the polyfill handler can be constant
            folded through. That is, if the polyfill handler is a pure function and its arguments
            are constant, the result of the polyfill handler can be constant folded during the
            compilation. Defaults to ``False``.
        skip_signature_check (bool, optional): Whether to skip the signature check between the
            original function and the polyfill handler. Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns:
        A decorator that registers the polyfill handler for the original function.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("conflict with the tests: duplicate polyfill handlers")
        >>> import operator
        >>> operator.indexOf([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)

    """
    Mark a tensor as having a dynamic dim and set corresponding min and max range for the dim.

    [Note - on the state of mark_dynamic]

    The behavior of having a dynamic dimension on a tensor is governed by a few factors:

    1) torch._dynamo.config dynamic_shapes True or False.
        a) dynamic_shapes=True - dynamic_shapes must be True for mark_dynamic to work.
        a) dynamic_shapes=False - This config will raise an exception when used in conjunction with
        mark_dynamic. We will eventually support this.

    2) If the dimension is fully constrained - as in, it does not allow more than a single value
    in both eager (torch.compile, torch._dynamo.optimize) mode and export mode (torch._dynamo.export),
    we will raise an error

    3) If the dimension is partially constrained - allowing at least 2 values but not the full unbounded
    range of shapes, in eager we will pass it through, but export will raise an error.

    4) Attempts to trace this function will explicitly raise. As such, all calls to mark_dynamic must be made
    before torch.compile.

    5) If specialize_on is passed in, we will perform a single generic Dynamo trace followed by
    multiple specialized compilations in addition to a single generic compilation. NB: For now we only support
    per dimension specialization, or in other words we do not generate a cross product of specializations.
    At runtime, we will dispatch to a specialized compiled region if the input matches the specialization criteria.

    For example:
        mark_dynamic(..., specialize_on=[
            lambda x: x == 8,
            lambda x: x == 16
        ])

    This approach results in one Dynamo trace and two backend compilations. When the input dimension equals 8 or 16
    at runtime, execution will be directed to the specialized compiled region. Performance measurements indicate
    2-8x speedups depending on the specific specialization and model architecture.

    Mark a tensor as having a static dim or mark a nn module class as static.

    For tensors
    ===========
    This will prevent us from attempting to compile it dynamically
    when dynamic=True; this can improve trace-time performance.

    This has lower precedence than mark_dynamic.

    Unlike mark_dynamic, this can be done inside a graph, in which case it
    induces specialization on the tensor.

    For nn.Module classes
    =====================
    For static nn.Module classes, TorchDynamo assumes that the module instance
    attributes will not be modified after compilation. This will ensure that
    TorchDynamo keeps integer attributes CONSTANT and not symints.

    From TorchDynamo implementation side, the instances of static-marked
    nn.Module class will be converted to UnspecializedBuiltinNNModuleVariable,
    which have the same properties.

    Note that we still have to guard on the attributes, because different
    instances of the nn.Module can have different values of the attributes. The
    key point here is that the attributes are static.
