This module is one of the analysis modules - it takes as input a function or graph
and some preexisting properties, and returns some data that is useful for deciding
how to further proceed with compilation or construct runtime wrappers.

In particular, the analysis here constructs view and mutation metadata from running
a functionalized version of the graph under compilation.
