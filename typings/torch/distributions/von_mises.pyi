    A circular von Mises distribution.

    This implementation uses polar coordinates. The ``loc`` and ``value`` args
    can be any real number (to facilitate unconstrained optimization), but are
    interpreted as angles modulo 2 pi.

    Example::
        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> m = VonMises(torch.tensor([1.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # von Mises distributed with loc=1 and concentration=1
        tensor([1.9777])

    :param torch.Tensor loc: an angle in radians.
    :param torch.Tensor concentration: concentration parameter
