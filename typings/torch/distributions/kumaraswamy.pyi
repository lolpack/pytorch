    Samples from a Kumaraswamy distribution.

    Example::

        >>> m = Kumaraswamy(torch.tensor([1.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # sample from a Kumaraswamy distribution with concentration alpha=1 and beta=1

        concentration1 (float or Tensor): 1st concentration parameter of the distribution
            (often referred to as alpha)
        concentration0 (float or Tensor): 2nd concentration parameter of the distribution
            (often referred to as beta)
