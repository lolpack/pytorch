class Gamma(ExponentialFamily):
    r"""
    Creates a Gamma distribution parameterized by shape :attr:`concentration` and :attr:`rate`.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> m = Gamma(torch.tensor([1.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # Gamma distributed with concentration=1 and rate=1
        tensor([ 0.1046])

    Args:
        concentration (float or Tensor): shape parameter of the distribution
            (often referred to as alpha)
        rate (float or Tensor): rate parameter of the distribution
            (often referred to as beta), rate = 1 / scale
