class Normal(ExponentialFamily):
    r"""
    Creates a normal (also called Gaussian) distribution parameterized by
    :attr:`loc` and :attr:`scale`.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> m = Normal(torch.tensor([0.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # normally distributed with loc=0 and scale=1
        tensor([ 0.1046])

    Args:
        loc (float or Tensor): mean of the distribution (often referred to as mu)
        scale (float or Tensor): standard deviation of the distribution
            (often referred to as sigma)
